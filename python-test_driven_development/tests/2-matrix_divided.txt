# Test cases for matrix_divided function

>>> from my_module import matrix_divided

# Test case 1: Regular matrix and positive divisor
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> matrix  # original matrix remains unchanged
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Test case 2: Matrix with negative numbers and divisor as a float
>>> matrix = [[-1, -2, -3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
[[-0.4, -0.8, -1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]
>>> matrix  # original matrix remains unchanged
[[-1, -2, -3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Test case 3: Matrix with zeros and divisor as an integer
>>> matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
>>> matrix  # original matrix remains unchanged
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

# Test case 4: Matrix with a single row
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5]]
>>> matrix  # original matrix remains unchanged
[[1, 2, 3]]

# Test case 5: Divisor is zero
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test case 6: Invalid matrix (not a list of lists)
>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test case 7: Rows of different sizes
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test case 8: Divisor is a string
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 'abc')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: div must be a number
